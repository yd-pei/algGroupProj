git clone https://github.com/yd-pei/algGroupProj.git
```

## Question Description

### Proj 3
Question 0. Teleportation in Astro haunted galaxies

You have a teleporter that can take you from galaxy i to galaxy j. Cost to teleport is given by c(i,j), which can be arbitrary. Some galaxies are “astro-haunted” – this is specified by a(i) which can be 0 or 1 (1 means that that galaxy is “astro-haunted”). Give a polynomial time algorithm that minimizes the cost of going from galaxy 1 to galaxy n, such that you pass through no more than k astro-haunted galaxies. (You can assume that galaxies 1 and n are not astro-haunted.)
